## 🌞 Overview

The **Coherence-Oriented Architectural Framework (COAF)** is a general-purpose system architecture framework designed to guide the transition from the unsustainable, entropy-increasing world system into a coherent, solar-powered, generative superorganism — enabled by nature, led by intelligence, and open to all.

This repository contains all you need to understand, extend, and use the COAF model — from full documentation, to reusable architecture models, to community contribution paths.

We also gratefully acknowledge the foundational contribution of the **Tiered Democratic Governance (TDG)** model by **Dave Volek**, available at [tiereddemocraticgovernance.org](https://www.tiereddemocraticgovernance.org/tdg), which informs and strengthens the governance design within COAF. TDG was originally conceptualized and developed by Dave Volek, who has published extensively on the model. While similar democratic mechanisms may exist in other contexts — such as Cuba’s system of local participatory governance — this reference version follows Volek’s publicly documented formulation as a coherent and accessible placeholder within COAF’s structure.

## 💡 Why This Exists
This framework is not a product. It is a prototype of the world we have to build — one made from coherence, truth, light, and solar intelligence. With nature’s energy and your intent, we have the tools — and we have to use them — to remake everything, starting now.

> “Creation can proceed infinitely, but only along the track of coherence.”

Let’s walk it.
