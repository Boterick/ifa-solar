# How to Contribute to COAF

Welcome to the Coherence-Oriented Architectural Framework (COAF)! This project is open to all who want to help shape a new planetary system based on coherence, solar energy, and systems truth.

You don’t need to be a developer or architect. You just need clarity of intent and willingness to work with natural law.
